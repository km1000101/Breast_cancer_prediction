# Breast_cancer_prediction
This model predicts whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on measurements from fine needle aspirate (FNA) images. It's trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset and achieves an accuracy of 98.6%. While machine learning models are powerful, they can be unpredictable, so it's important to use them alongside expert medical opinion.
